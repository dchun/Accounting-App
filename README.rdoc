Accounting App

This is just a simple app I built to keep track of my revenue and expenses.

Added companies, revenues, and expenses.

To do:

join expenses with companies.
represent data from revenues and expenses on index.
add asset, liability and equity tables
bring everything together in a debit and credit table.
